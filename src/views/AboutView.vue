            <p>
                RVCAT (RISC-V Code Analysis Tool) is a simulation tool for the performance analysis of small programs from a computer architecture educational standpoint.
            </p>
            <p>
                RVCAT and its web interface (RVCAT-Web) have been developed on
                the Computer Architecture and Operating Systems Department of
                the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB) by Saul Adserias,
                Quim Aguado Puig, and Juan C. Moure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulator and web interface are still under active
                development. If you find any bugs or want to help improving the
                tools (for example, as part of a final degree project), please
                contact your professors.
